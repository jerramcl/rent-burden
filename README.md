This project analyzes displacement risk in Los Angeles and San Francisco counties by evaluating key economic and social factors that contribute to housing instability. Displacement refers to involuntary relocation of people or businesses from their current location, commonly known as eviction. Using data from the CDC, and the U.S. Census this study examines median rent burden, health outcomes, and demographic vulnerabilities across different populations. The analysis includes comparisons of renters, homeowners, racial groups, seniors, and children, using metrics such as the proportion of rent-burdened households, high mortgage costs, reliance on SNAP benefits, uninsured seniors, and children living below the poverty line. Findings reveal that LA County has a higher displacement risk due to a greater percentage of rent-burdened individuals, poorer health outcomes, and a larger proportion of marginalized populations, particularly Black and Hispanic residents who face greater financial instability. While SF County has a higher proportion of homeowners with expensive mortgages, its higher median income and lower rent burden suggest that housing stability is relatively better than in LA. The study acknowledges limitations, including the inability to control for income disparities and broader economic trends, which may influence housing risk. Ultimately, LA emerges as the more vulnerable county in terms of displacement, though further research into local policies, income distribution, and access to affordable housing could provide a deeper understanding of these disparities.
